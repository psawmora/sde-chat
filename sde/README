How to start
============

Server - Go to 'sde/src/main/java/msc/sde/chat/service/display/impl'
         and run main method in 'ServerConsole'
         (Typically open the project from your favourite IDE and run the main method of 'ServerConsole' class.)

Client - Go to 'sde/src/main/java/msc/sde/chat/service/display/impl'
         and run main method in 'ClientConsole'
         Multiple instances of clients can be started and you can simulate chat room environment.
         (Typically open the project from your favourite IDE and run the main method of 'ClientConsole' class.)

Typical initial commands to test the flow
==========================================

    #signup <username> <password>
    #login <username> <password>
    If you want to send messages to all clients, just type the message and enter.
    If you want to send a private message to a specific client use command:
        #private <receiver-username> <message>
    Look for 'Commands' section to get details of all the commands.
